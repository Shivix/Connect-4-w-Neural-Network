# Connect-4-w-Neural-Network
A newer version of the Connect 4 game that utilizes a genetic neural network as well as the minimax algorithm.

Currently a work in progress, but I have decided to upload and update it each day to show the steps I take to create a program, rather than just the finished progress. 
This also gives a better indication of the amount of programming I do each day. (A lot, I love programming, though not as much as I wish due to looking for work currently)
